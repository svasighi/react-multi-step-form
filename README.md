This project is built with Tailwind, TypeScript, React, PostCss ,and CSS Modules. The main purpose of this project is to showcase my skills and knowledge in using these technologies.

## Technologies Learned

Throughout the development of this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of the following technologies:

- **Tailwind**: A utility-first CSS framework that allowed me to quickly and easily style my components without having to write custom CSS.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that helped me write more robust and maintainable code by providing type checking and other features.
- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces that allowed me to create reusable and composable components.
- **CSS Modules**: A CSS file format that allowed me to write modular and reusable CSS code for my components.
- **PostCss**: A software development tool that uses JavaScript-based plugins to automate routine CSS operations.[3] It was designed by Andrey Sitnik with the idea taking its origin in his front-end work for Evil Martians.[4]
